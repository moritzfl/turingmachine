This software is meant for teaching the principles of [turning-machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) as a fundamental concept in the field of IT.

The software is licensed under the terms of GPL3 because it uses JLaTeXMath for rendering the user interface. 

If you want to use any other class that was directly written by me you can however just contact me.
